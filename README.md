# surfs_up

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze temperature trends in order to get a better perspective on when W.Avy should open the surf shop. In this analysis, we analyzed June and December temperature data for the island of Oahu, a potential location. This analysis uses advanced data storage and retreival to get the temperatures for Oahu. In addition, the analysis was done using Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy.

Here are the results for the June Temperature information.

Here are the results for the December Temperature information.


## Summary

- Both sets of data seem to be similar in all categories, with perhaps slightly more variation between the minimum temperatures with a difference of 8 degrees, whereas the rest of the data seems to be within 2-4 degrees of each other. 
- The average temperature for both times of year is in the 70s. 
- The temperature in Oahu seems to be similar in both June and December, implying that the temperature is stable throughout the seasons. 

Due to the similarity in temperature during height of what would be considered "summer" and "winter", I would say that W.Avy should not be concerned on whether or not the ice cream shop would be sustainable year-round. The data shows that the temperatures are similar enough that there wouldn't seem to be a big dip in whether people would enjoy ice cream or not, purely based off seeing the temperature. However, it is not enough to base a large decision like this on just one data factor. I would try to do analysis over all months of the year, and on multiple years in order to get a more robust window into how temperatures vary in Oahu. In addition, I would also look into natural disasters in Hawaii, especially with the sea level rise due to climate change. I would do some research into this since Oahu seems like a good place based on past physicality with temperature and low precipitation levels, but it would be a mistake to not take into account perhaps the areas on the island most prone to sea level rise (and other factors) due to the global change in environment.
